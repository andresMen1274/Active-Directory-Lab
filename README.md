# Active-Directory-Lab
In this lab I will be creating an active directory lab. The lab will have two servers, a switch, router, kali Linux machine, and a windows 10 machine.

First I will begin the lab by creating a diagram to display what network I intend to create. I will be using draw.io to create the diagram. Since this is an active directory lab I will have two servers on the network. The first server will be used as a splunk server to have logs, events, and metrics. The second server will be used used as an actve directory sever which is used for authentication, group policies, and computer management. I will then have a Windows 10 machine that is connected to the splunk server to forward data to the server as well as be connected to the switch. Then I will have a kali linux machine that is connected to the switch and used to simulate attacks.

Now I already have the kali linux machine
